3 ways to classify a sample:

1) time between the transient and the hit
2) frequency content of the hit
	- in order to find transient, you go by volume and the part of the snare with the deepest hit
3) Volume Envelope (aka slope of the sound after the hit)
4) length of the sound after the hit

How it works:

1) Anaylze library of samples
	a. create a profile of each sample
2) Drop Here box
3) Searches for similarity between other samples
4) Returns result based on percentage
